# Simple Tax Calculator application

I picked Vue.js and vuex as I feel that's my strong side on the front-end. I've tried to showcase my CSS/SCSS skills so I choosed not to use any design framework, it took a little bit more time then I expected so unfortunetly couldn't do any testing.

## Project setup

```
